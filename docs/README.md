# Exploding Kittens Team 6

##  Project settings

- Modular JavaFX project using Maven
- Project SDK/language level: 11
- (Fat) jar built using the Maven Shade plugin (multiplatform) (target/Software-design-vu-2020-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)

Note: For some reason the IDE sometimes loads the project wrongly and has to be specifically told to reload using Maven, perhaps after a cache invalidation + restart.
